# Maze-Solver
Maze Solver
1. The project is about building a ME (Maze Solver) application using Java language.
2. The ME solver is a 2D grid with a starting and ending point, and the goal is to find any possible path between them.
3. The grid will have different colored blocks, white blocks represent obstacles, and black blocks are the ones through which the path can go and green block is the destination.
4. The maze is represented by a 2D array named "grid" that contains 0(accessible), 1(blocker), and 9(destination) elements.
5. We will be using DFS(Depth First Search) algorithm to reach far away from the starting point while accessing elements in the array.
